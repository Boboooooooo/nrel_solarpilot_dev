Release notes
----------------
v2014.11.9


-- since v2014.9.16 --
* Added z-axis scale options. Can auto-adjust color axis for flux map, aim point plot or specify bounds.
* Added a check when calculating heliostat efficiency to determine whether heliostat is within the projected cylinder of the receiver. This may be useful when doing flux profiling.
* Improved consistency of calls to build flux map and field plot pages. This allows more consistent binding of controls instantiated on those pages.
